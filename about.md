Hi my name is Karina Zhang and I'm a junior studying Computer Science. 

### More Information

I'm interested in web and iOS development and I'm excited to learn more about contributing to open source. 

In my free time, I'm learning to play guitar and cook. I also like playing video games and binging shows on Netflix.
